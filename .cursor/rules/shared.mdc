# Shared Rules for CoachFlow Project

These rules apply across both frontend and backend.

## TypeScript Usage

- Always use TypeScript for all code.
- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json.
- Use explicit types for function parameters and returns.

## Naming Conventions

- Variables and functions: camelCase
- Classes and components: PascalCase
- Constants: UPPER_CASE
- Interfaces: PascalCase with 'I' prefix if needed, but prefer without.

## Git Practices

- Use conventional commits for commit messages (e.g., feat: add new feature).
- Branch naming: feature/branch-name, bugfix/branch-name.

## Error Handling

- Always handle errors gracefully.
- Use try-catch for async operations.
- Log errors with context.

## Code Style

- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting.
- Limit line length to 100 characters.
- Prefer async/await over promises.

## AI Development Guidelines

- When generating code, ensure it integrates with existing stack (Vue 3, NestJS, Prisma).
- Prefer modular code and separation of concerns.
- Include comments for complex logic.
